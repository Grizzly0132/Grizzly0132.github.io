        <h1>Information about me</h1>
        <p>I am a 17 year old student. I live in Romania, in Transilvania, I am hungarian. I love computer sience,
            but I also like, kind of everything.
        </p>
        <p>I want to study further computer since. I already know a few programing languages like: C++, C#,
            Python, Java
        </p>
        <p>
            I also know linux. It's one of my favorite hobbys, facinates me. I made some small games
            in Unreal engine(3D) and in Unity(2D).
        </p>
        <p>
            What I really like about myself would be the fact that I like to learn stuff that I like, and I can
            learn these really fast, with ese. If I dont know something, I ususally just try to figur it out alone,
            and this way I know to do a lot of stuff(cooking, fixing, PC building, DIY everything).
